Cross-platform development environments for `blackglasses` at [TheAltF4Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/thealtf4stream) on Twitch.

## Goals

Maintain declarative configurations for development environments that are reproducible on any operating system (Windows not included).

### Why move from Manjaro + Ansible?

I started using `Manjaro w/ i3-gaps` as my development operating system and `Ansible` to automate maintaining it ([see more here](http://github.com/ALT-F4-LLC/dotfiles)). This has been a solid solution and is my recommended way of getting started with development environment automation.

However, I began to deal with challenges of maintaining imperative automation. Things like making sure one step works so another can, having proper dependencies at the right time and other challenges that required more automation steps.

I wanted declarative configurations rather than imperative steps for my development environments.

### Why NixOS?

- TBD

### Why macOS + nix-darwin?
